# Cybersecurity-Bootcamp 
## Essential Project at Jedha
## Project

During all this bootcamp, you've learned fundamental skills in cybersecurity.

It is now time for you to perform a penetration test and every single step to evaluate your target security.

Your final project is to run a real penetration test over the **EvilCorp** server who commissioned you for this mission.

## Deliverable

When running a real-life pentest, you will need to write what's called a _pentest report_. It is a document that you will hand out to your client with the following information:

- Managerial summary
- Technical summary
- List of vulnerabilities
- Vulnerabilities remediation

To do that, you can either use a custom template, or this [pwndoc](https://github.com/pwndoc/pwndoc). PwnDoc is a pentest reporting application that helps you write well formated pentest report.

You should also have a look on the [CVSSv3 scoring system](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/user-guide).

Additionnally, you are asked to present the vulnerabilities you found during your pentest.

Your presentation will last about 10 minutes. You will create a visual presentation with, for instance, some slides and explain how you made your recon phase, what caught your eyes to discover the vulnerability, how you exploited it and what are the remediations you advise.

To summarize, you will need to produce:

1. A pentest report
2. Slides for your presentation

### Objectives

- Perform a pentest in complete autonomy
- Redact the report
- Make an oral presentation of at least one vulnerability

To help you, here is a graph representing what you should be able to find.

As you can see, your report can count up to 9 vulnerabilities!
